# Family Friday!

I decided to go with a Rails scaffolding with Postgres approach. Family friday pairings can be generated by using the /employees/groups route and every time the page is loaded it will generate a new family friday pairings.

Group sizes are arbitrarily sized at 4 on average, although I also worked up but didn't implement logic for base pairings of 3 and 5.
